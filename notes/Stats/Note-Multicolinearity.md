# Multicollinearity

![Multicolinearity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/askming/picgo/master/Multicolinearity.png)

## Cause

1. Structural: e.g. $x \ \&\ x^2$, interaction term and the main effect included in the interaction term
2. Data: by nature two variables are correlatd

## Eeffect

- Inference of covariate
  - $\beta$ becomes sensitive to small change in the model
  - imprecise (i.e. large s.e.) of $\beta\rightarrow$ large p-value, low power
- NO effect on goodness-of-fit nor on model prediction

## Diagnosis

- **VIF: variance inflation factor** of variable  $x_i$, higher the worse (usually < 5 is moderate), is defined as:

  $$\text{VIF}_i = \frac{1}{1-R_i^2}$$

  where $R_i^2$ is the *coefficient of determination* when regression $X_i$ on the rest of the indepdent variables.

## Treatment â€‹

1. Structural: standardize indepndent variable, e.g. $X' = X - \bar{X}$
2. Variables that are not of interest: no need to worry
3. Variables that are of interest:
   1. remove some of the highly correlated variables
   2. Linearly combine the variables, e.g. adding them together
   3. PCA or PLSR (partial least squares regression, ?)
